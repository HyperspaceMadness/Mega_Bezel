  * Split background (Background and Bezel image?) and shift halves to far left and right
  * Add Sharp Pixel Preset - No CRT Processing, Options for reflection area, Adjustable Quilez Sharpening?
  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale, why? Maybe only in Portrait Res
  * Need x Scale for screen size of Independent bezel
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode

  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified
  * Reflection on Control Panel and Speaker Panel

  * Black edge should scale with tube (It's much larger when the tube scaling is smaller)
  
  * Add Deconvergence (Dogway Glass?)
  * Simulated Gamma & Display Gamma
  * Calibrate brightness of crt shaders & LCD to Guest-Venom

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys

  * Scanlines
    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
    * Fake Scanline improvements
      * Parameterized scanline behavior, thickness etc
      * Implement Rolling scanlines & interference similar to Newpixie-Crt
  * Auto Aspect Ratio
    *  Bloody Roar II and Tobal 2, Tekken 3 and R4 (Tekken 3 & 4 are registering as vertical)
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?

Documentation
  Setup
    Turn off video rotation 

  Troubleshooting 
    New install of retroarch 
    Turn all overlays off 
    I have rings, wavy distortions (Moire)

  Vertical Arcade game setup
    FBNeo
    Mame 2003
    Mame 2010

Moire
  The Waves you are seeing are called a Moire effect, itâ€™s the same effect you see through a screen door sometimes.
  It is caused by using a crt shader with scanlines and tube curvature and made worse when the resolution is limited. It is a thorny problem , and sometimes hard to get rid of at 1080, it is much less of a problem at 4k.
  Things which can help/fix the problem
    Reducing strength of scanlines, 
    Reducing or curvature or setting it to 0 will definitely fix it.
    If you keep using curvature using Integer scale in the shader parameters can sometimes help.

    If making own presets reference from crt-Base presets

Retroarch Features
  * Add "Timer" uniform variable vec4(total-count, count-since-shader-load, oscillator[1,0,1,0,1,...], [unknown/undefined])
    * Unknown could be frames since direction change, good for rewind effect 
  * Shaders folder as a path token, e.g. "[shaders]/shaders_slang/"
  * Hide Parameters
  * Add Shader Preset - to add a shader preset to the beginning of the chain
  * Fix MyTextureNameSize for textures in Vulkan
  * Shader Textures in Sub Menu - Add ability to set texture overrides in retroarch UI
  * Shader Passes in Sub Menu
  * Reload Last Preset
  * Original scaling Type?
  * MaxAbsolute scaling type?
  * Add Preset to beginning of chain (Autechre's request )
  * Next/Previous Shader sometimes uses different directories, probably related to shader_path in live shader rather than originally loaded preset
  * Replace Text, for shader type, game & core, content directory
    core_name
    game_name
    [shadertype], [gamename], [corename], [contentdirectory]
    * Check textures and use default if not found
  * Multiple references in one file for adding passes and parameter overrides
  * Add Shader Preset - In UI Add a shader preset to Concatenate passes at beginning of shader stack
  * Fix loss of current parameter values when retroarch goes from full screen to window
  * Add History other than OriginalHistory1 ...
  * Fix <texture>Size, only works for textures in DX11, 12, not Vulkan
  * Video Aspect Ratio which uses Monitor
  * Stop Reloading Shader multiple times on Save (Keep optional param)
  * GIF support
  * Check for alias used multiple times appears as semantic error now
  * global.x is semantic error if x not in global


  Notes:
  Fake Scanlines
    Parameter for simulated line count
    Option to try to match a integer division of the core resolution
    Option for integer "perfect" scanlines
    Offset on scan axis
    Curvature Multiplier
    Try mame hlsl darkening
    Check Lottes tone mapping
    Crawl

  Super Glow HighFX Version?, manage brightness

Changes:
  * Fixed Potato Black Edge Corner
  * Added Fake Scanlines option to colored Gel
  * Changed Gel to use Vignette for shading

----------------------------------------------------
--- TODO  ---------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
--- Examples  --------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
  * Punch Out - Dual Screen
  * Vector Preset



----------------------------------------------------
--- Post V1  ---------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
  * Auto Rotate
  * Investigate Higher Ambient Light Multiplier on BG
  * Original scaling mode to deal with black final viewport in Parallel RDP in both mupen and Parallel cores.
  * Compensate for Negative Crop, 
    * User crop values should be relative to original core image, not core image + negative crop area 
  * Missing inner Edge static shading?
  * Guess White/Black Matting?
  * Auto Shadow for image Layers above screen
  * Mega Back Light a la philips Hue/Ambient
  * Night light single glow - Place Glows
  * Fix Corner Shading
  * Double Bezel
  * Swap option for Blurry vs Sharp Tube Reflection
  * Add NTSC Adaptive Preset?
  * Add Variations CRT Royale Glass & Advanced
  * Do some more OrionsAngel Presets with new Mega_Bezel
  * Add option for core res fake scanlines
  * Add Rewind Effect?
  * Black Edges should be driven by bezel not screen? (Right now bezel overlaps the screen with no black line)
  * When in interlacing mode for vertical opposite mult should do something
  * Fix bright area of screen showing outside the black line when bezel is hidden
  Update Docs & add some notes about GDV & Grade
  * Rotate Dual Screen
  * Adjust Black adjustment so it affects not just black, Falloff? Tweak Afterglow?
  * Modulate Range on top of Hue & Value?
  * Logo Position offset?
  * LCD behavior when reaching resolution limit
  * Local vs FullScreen Blur on Corner reflection?
  * Shadow from Cutout?
  * Large Slotmask Bitmap Mask
  * Do Hylian Sync Version



----------------------------------------------------
--- Independent Shader Stuff for Main Repo  --------
----------------------------------------------------
  * Add Test_Max_Resources to Repo
  * Make Resolution text shader it's own pass for Repo
    * Show Original Res, Previous Pass Res, Next Pass Res, Viewport
    * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified

  * Gameboy
    * Fix DMG Shader
    * Fix Low Contrast Issue
    * Multiple palettes including Custom for Gameboy  
    * Add Gameboy Palettes https://www.deviantart.com/thewolfbunny/gallery/69987002/game-boy-palettes

  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale
    * Why? Maybe only in Portrait Res?
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode
  * See why very inner edge seems not affected by reflection mask
  * Startup Animation - Sprite Sheet

  * Frame Shading
    * Shading on frame interior edge?
    * Frame Inner edge static lighter line
    * Frame Interior Edge thickness
    * Fix shading with rounded outer corner
    * Frame shadow should follow corner radius

  * Integer Scale Guides?
  * Reflection fade option to have reflection come to 100% at inner frame boundary so you can have a glass like effect outside the bezel
  * Per Layer Scaling of Cutout?
  * Noise Sampling on Tube Highlight
  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Reflection on Control Panel and Speaker Panel

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys?

  * Scanlines
    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?




Documentation
  Troubleshooting 
    New install of retroarch 
    Turn all overlays off 
    I have rings, wavy distortions (Moire)

Moire
  The Waves you are seeing are called a Moire effect, itâ€™s the same effect you see through a screen door sometimes.
  It is caused by using a crt shader with scanlines and tube curvature and made worse when the resolution is limited. It is a thorny problem , and sometimes hard to get rid of at 1080, it is much less of a problem at 4k.
  Things which can help/fix the problem
    Reducing strength of scanlines, 
    Reducing or curvature or setting it to 0 will definitely fix it.
    If you keep using curvature using Integer scale in the shader parameters can sometimes help.

    If making own presets reference from crt-Base presets

--- Retroarch Features -----------------------------
----------------------------------------------------

  * Append (Prepend) Shader Preset - to add a shader preset to the beginning of the chain
  * Fix edit shader in UI - Changes are currently lost or need to apply twice
  * Fix loss of current parameter values when retroarch goes from full screen to window
  * Fix saving with same name with different capitalization creates self reference
  * Shaders folder as a path token, e.g. "[shaders]/shaders_slang/" [shaders_dir]?
  * Hide Parameters
  * Add Core Provided Aspect as Uniform

  * Stop Reloading Shader multiple times on Save (Keep optional param)

  * Choose Textures in UI
    * Shader Textures in Sub Menu - Add ability to set texture overrides in retroarch UI
    * Shader Passes in Sub Menu

  * Dropdowns for indexed parameters?
  * Multiple references in one file for adding passes and parameter overrides
  * Edit Multiple References in UI vs Shader Passes, Discreetly change between Simple and Full

  * Onscreen Display of current shader preset
  * Reload Last Preset

  * Next/Previous Shader does not work well if shader was loaded as Game preset
    * Sometimes uses different directories, probably related to shader_path in live shader rather than originally loaded preset

  * Pass Scaling Types
    * Original scaling Type
    * MaxAbsolute scaling type?
      * If res is lower don't scale if larger scale to this res, good for PSX Upscaling
      * Would avoid people crashing with internal resolution multiple

  * Add "Timer" uniform variable vec4(total-count, count-since-shader-load, oscillator[1,0,1,0,1,...], [unknown/undefined])
    * Unknown could be frames since direction change, good for rewind effect 

  * Replace Text, for shader type, game & core, content directory
    * core_name
    * game_name
    * [shadertype], [gamename], [corename], [contentdirectory]
    * Check textures and use default if not found
    
  * Check for alias used multiple times appears as semantic error now
  * global.x is semantic error if x not in global
  * GIF support
  * Fix <texture>Size, only works for textures in DX11, 12, not Vulkan

  Super Glow HighFX Version?, manage brightness

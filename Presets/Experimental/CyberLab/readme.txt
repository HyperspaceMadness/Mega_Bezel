Try the presets in the MBZ__1__Advance_Full_Reflections folder first.

If you're system can't handle them, you can lower your desktop resolution and try the optimized presets for that resolution. 

If they're still not running well enough or if you prefer to stick to your native resolution then try the presets in the MBZ__2__Performance_No_Reflections folder.

You can also use a lower desktop resolution and the optimized presets for that resolution from the MBZ__2__Performance_No_Reflections folder for maximum performance.


These presets require the HSM Mega Bezel Reflection Shader in order to work.
It can be downloaded at the following location.

I recommend using Arcade - Sharp PVM Edition for arcade games, Composite - Pure for NES and similar systems and Composite - Sharp PVM Edition for the 16-bit era systems and everything else except games that rely on dithering to generate additional colours and transparency effects that aren’t being handled well enough by the Composite - Sharp preset. For those cases, I recommend using my Blending and Transparency PVM Edition preset.

Be sure to check out my brand new Computer Monitor - Raw and Computer Monitor - Sharp presets! They seem to excel at everything thrown at them. This time around the Raw preset really holds it's own but the Sharp is just a sight to behold especially on Arcade games! 

There are a couple caveats though. The 4K optimized ones are slightly darker than my other presets and they of course require at least a 4K display to get the full effect. With that said, they probably represent some of my best work to date! So if you have the requisite equipment you're in for a real treat!

My current personal favorite preset in the pack is my Computer Monitor - Sharp preset.

You can play around with the MDAPT setting if you want that one to handle blending and transparency as well. I suggest setting MDAPT to 2 for most games that use dither patterns but 3 for games like Sonic The Hedgehog.

When finished adjusting, you can save either a Game Preset or a Core Preset.

I also recommend you get familiar with the Cropping settings to eliminate black borders or screen junk in some games. After you’re satisfied with your Cropping settings save a Game Preset.

Be sure to spread the word that these exist so that others may also benefit!

Note: If you’re using Higan or BSNES, the resolution setting in the core options can influence how your final image looks in terms of sharpness and softness. In games that you might prefer a crisper, sharper look for example Super Mario World and Super Mario Kart, you can try switching it to 512 x 224. Conversely in games that use dithering to create extra colours for example U.N. Squadron and TMNT: Turtles In Time and Final Fight, 256 x 224 might be the better choice. You can save your choice in Quick Menu…Options…Manage Core Options and save per game.

If you’re also looking for the infamous " Rainbow effect" you can use my presets above and also enable Blargg’s NTSC Composite filter in the Genesis Plus GX Core Options. It might even work with my Composite - Pure preset as well but I haven’t tested it yet.

What I’ve noticed is that once the Blargg NTSC Composite Filter is enabled and used in conjunction with my Composite - Sharp preset, dithering based transparencies also work fine, whereas without the Blargg filter set to composite that particular preset didn’t do the transparency effects properly. So I went back to the drawing board and came up with this next preset. It’s not a one size fits all solution as it can cause some artifacts due to false positives in certain games but when it works, it works beautifully!


CyberLab__Blending-And-Transparency__PVM-Edition__ADV.slangp 

(formerly CyberLab Mega Bezel Death To Pixels Blending and Transparency PVM Edition Edition.slangp)

Note: This preset needs the “CyberLab Mega Bezel Death To Pixels Composite Sharp PVM Edition.slangp” preset to be in the same folder for it to work.

So now you can get the best of both worlds. Extra colours, transparency effects and the rainbow effect without blurry graphics as if Vaseline was smeared all over the screen.


Thanks again to all who made this possible!
